## General Background Knowledge of React

- Reason to use react is we dont want to wait for new pages to load or actions to start
  - Traditional web apps, you click the button, send request and wait for sever to send you new HTML page
  - But we when use javascript, it runs in the browser, we can manipulate the DOM of the page. In this case, no visible request to the server is required, no need to wait for a new HTML page as a response.

> React is a clint-side javaScript library for building User Interface.

- javascript you need to write every action, every steps for the code. We are doing
repetitive task.
- In react, we can custome HTML components and elements. split the application into small components. every component has clear task, the react will render them, aka, react will do the repetitive task for us.
